asking for us to use the provided API and its endpoints to create a platform for sharing listings and make bids
<br>

Authentication<br><sub>- Users should be able to registrer and log in or out</sub> <br><br>
Fetch API/HTTP Request Methods<br><sub>- Create, change or delete their own listings</sub> <br><br>
Javascript<br><sub>- Listings should have an ending time, making a user win a listing with the highest bid</sub> <br><br>

This project uses mainly:
- Javascript
